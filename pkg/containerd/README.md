# containerd

Containerd is a daemon to control runC, built for performance and density. 
Containerd leverages runC's advanced features such as seccomp and user namespace support as well
as checkpoint and restore for cloning and live migration of containers.

## Getting started

The easiest way to start using containerd is to download binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/docker/containerd/releases).

The included `ctr` command-line tool allows you interact with the containerd daemon:

```
$ sudo ctr containers start redis /containers/redis
$ sudo ctr containers list
ID                  PATH                STATUS              PROCESSES
1                   /containers/redis   running             14063
```

`/containers/redis` is the path to an OCI bundle. [See the docs for more information.](docs/bundle.md)

## Docs

 * [Client CLI reference (`ctr`)](docs/cli.md)
 * [Daemon CLI reference (`containerd`)](docs/daemon.md)
 * [Creating OCI bundles](docs/bundle.md)
 * [containerd changes to the bundle](docs/bundle-changes.md)
 * [Attaching to STDIO or TTY](docs/attach.md)
 * [Telemetry and metrics](docs/telemetry.md)

All documentation is contained in the `/docs` directory in this repository.

## Building

You will need to make sure that you have Go installed on your system and the containerd repository is cloned
in your `$GOPATH`.  You will also need to make sure that you have all the dependencies cloned as well.
Currently, contributing to containerd is not for the first time devs as many dependencies are not vendored and 
work is being completed at a high rate.  

After that just run `make` and the binaries for the daemon and client will be localed in the `bin/` directory.

## Performance

Starting 1000 containers concurrently runs at 126-140 containers per second.

Overall start times:

## Roadmap

The current roadmap and milestones for alpha and beta completion are in the github issues on this repository.  Please refer to these issues for what is being worked on and completed for the various stages of development.

### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your
signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass
it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

```
Developer Certificate of Origin

San Francisco, CA 94110 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.
