Go package for creating, managing, inspecting, and destroying cgroups.
The resources format for settings on the cgroup uses the OCI runtime-spec found
[here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec).

## Examples

### Create a new cgroup

This creates a new cgroup using a static path for all subsystems under `/test`.

* /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/test
* /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/test
* etc....

It uses a single hierarchy and specifies cpu shares as a resource constraint and
uses the v1 implementation of cgroups.


```go
shares := uint64(100)
control, err := cgroups.New(cgroups.V1, cgroups.StaticPath("/test"), &specs.LinuxResources{
    CPU: &specs.CPU{
        Shares: &shares,
    },
})
defer control.Delete()
```

### Create with systemd slice support


```go
control, err := cgroups.New(cgroups.Systemd, cgroups.Slice("system.slice", "runc-test"), &specs.LinuxResources{
    CPU: &specs.CPU{
        Shares: &shares,
    },
})

```

### Load an existing cgroup

```go
control, err = cgroups.Load(cgroups.V1, cgroups.StaticPath("/test"))
```

### Add a process to the cgroup

```go
if err := control.Add(cgroups.Process{Pid:1234}); err != nil {
}
```

###  Update the cgroup 

To update the resources applied in the cgroup

```go
shares = uint64(200)
if err := control.Update(&specs.LinuxResources{
    CPU: &specs.CPU{
        Shares: &shares,
    },
}); err != nil {
}
```

### Freeze and Thaw the cgroup

```go
if err := control.Freeze(); err != nil {
}
if err := control.Thaw(); err != nil {
}
```

### List all processes in the cgroup or recursively

```go
processes, err := control.Processes(cgroups.Devices, recursive)
```

### Get Stats on the cgroup

```go
stats, err := control.Stat()
```

### Move process across cgroups

This allows you to take processes from one cgroup and move them to another.

```go
err := control.MoveTo(destination)
```

### Create subcgroup

```go
subCgroup, err := control.New("child", resources)
```
